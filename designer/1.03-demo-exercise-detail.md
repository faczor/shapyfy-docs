# 1.03 - Demo Exercise Detail

> **Navigation:** [1.02 Exercise Selection](1.02-demo-exercise-selection.md) → Exercise Detail (Demo) → [1.04 Success + Fork](1.04-success-fork.md)
> **Belongs to:** [1 - Onboarding](../features/1-onboarding.md)

## 1. Visual Preview
> [!TIP]
> *[Insert Screen Mockup Here]*
> *For now, we can use a placeholder or a Mermaid diagram if applicable.*

## 2. Human-Readable Summary
**User Behavior**
The user lands on the exercise detail screen to log their first set. This is a "demo" version of the real screen they will use later. They see a helpful tip banner explaining what to do. Once they log a single set, the app automatically celebrates and moves them to the next step.

**Key Cases**
*   **First Time Experience**: The screen always treats this as the first time doing the exercise, showing a "First time!" message and empty input fields.
*   **Auto-Navigation**: Logging one set triggers an automatic transition to the success screen.

**Data Displayed**
*   **Exercise Name**: (e.g., "Bench Press")
*   **Tip Banner**: "This is where you'll log all your sets in the gym. Try logging one!"
*   **Input Fields**: Weight and Reps (empty).

## 3. Detailed Designer Specification
### <exercise_detail_onboarding_demo>

**Screen Reference**
This screen uses **`<exercise_detail_first_time_exercise>`** from [2-workout_process.md](../features/2-workout_process.md) as its base, with the following modifications for onboarding:

#### Behavioral Modifications (when `isOnboardingDemo=true`)

**1. Demo Exercise Always Shows First-Time State:**
- Demo exercises (Bench Press, Dumbbell Press, Squat) show "🎉 First time doing this exercise!" message
- No historical data displayed (even if user has done exercise before)
- Input fields start empty (no pre-fill from history)

**2. Optional Onboarding Tip Banner** (above Exercise Info Card):
- Position: Below top bar
- Background: #FFF9E6 (light warm yellow)
- Border bottom: 1 dp solid #F0E5C8
- Padding: 12 dp horizontal, 10 dp vertical
- Dismissible: No (auto-dismisses after navigation)

**Tip Content:**
- Icon: 💡 (left side, 20 dp)
- Text: "This is where you'll log all your sets in the gym. Try logging one!"
- Font: 14 sp / Regular
- Color: #666666

**3. Auto-Navigate After First Set:**
- After user logs 1 set → **Automatically navigate to Success + Fork Screen**
- Skip "Finish Exercise" button requirement
- Pass logged set data forward to Success screen
- Temp workout session is created but NOT persisted to history

**4. Back Navigation:**
- Back arrow → Returns to Exercise Selection screen (not Active Workout)
- Allows user to change exercise choice if desired

#### Data Handling

**Temporary Workout Session:**
- Create temp ActiveWorkout session with selected exercise in "In Progress" state
- Log set data normally using real ExerciseSet model
- After navigating to Success + Fork → Discard entire temp session
- Data is NOT persisted to workout history database

**Purpose of This Approach:**
- ✅ Users experience the actual app interface (authentic demo)
- ✅ Zero learning curve on first real workout
- ✅ Builds confidence: "I already know how to use this!"
- ✅ No duplicate UI code to maintain
- ✅ Shows app quality immediately

#### Example Flow
```
User taps "Bench Press" card
  ↓
Navigate to Exercise Detail Screen
  - isOnboardingDemo = true
  - exerciseName = "Bench Press"
  - Shows first-time state UI
  ↓
User logs: 80 kg × 10 reps
  ↓
Auto-navigate to Success + Fork Screen
  - Passes: exerciseName="Bench Press", weight=80, reps=10
  - Temp workout session discarded
```

</exercise_detail_onboarding_demo>

## 4. Notes
*   **Design Philosophy**: Authentic demo experience. Uses the real UI to build confidence and reduce learning curve.
*   **Developer Notes**:
    *   **Flag Implementation**: Pass `isOnboardingDemo=true`.
    *   **Auto-Navigation**: Trigger on `setCount == 1`.
    *   **Session Management**: Use temporary session, do not persist to DB.
    *   **Full Reference**: See `2-workout_process.md` for the base UI spec.
