# Problem: Stuck in Spreadsheets

## The Pain Point
**"Excel is for Taxes, Not Triceps"**
You're serious about training, so you track everything. But you're using Google Sheets on your phone.
- You're pinching and zooming to find cell B42.
- You're typing "=SUM(C2:C10)" with sweaty thumbs.
- You have to scroll back 400 rows to see what you lifted last month.
It works, but it's friction. And friction kills focus.

## The Shapyfy Solution
**Spreadsheet Power, App Speed**
We built Shapyfy for the spreadsheet refugees.
- **Auto-History**: We show you your last lift *right on the input screen*. No scrolling required.
- **Visual Trends**: We turn those rows of data into beautiful charts automatically. See your volume go up without writing a formula.
- **Flexibility**: Like a spreadsheet, we don't force you into a rigid box. Add any exercise, any time. But we do the math for you.

### Idea 1: The "Before/After" (Image/Carousel)
**Left**: A messy, zoomed-out spreadsheet on a phone screen. Text: "Your current tracking method."
**Right**: Shapyfy's clean "Active Workout" screen with history pre-filled. Text: "Your upgrade."

### Idea 2: The Founder Story (Video)
"I tracked my workouts in spreadsheets for 5 years. I loved the data, but hated the experience. So I built Shapyfy to give me the data *without* the pinch-to-zoom."

### Idea 3: The "Math" Hook
"Stop doing math between sets. Shapyfy calculates your volume, 1RM estimates, and total tonnage automatically. Save your brain power for the lift."
