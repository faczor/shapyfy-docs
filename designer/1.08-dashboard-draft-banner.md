**Key Cases**
*   **Banner Visible**: When a program is saved as a draft and no active workout is in progress.
*   **Starting**: Tapping "Start Day 1" launches the workout.
*   **Viewing**: Tapping "View" opens the plan preview screen.

**Data Displayed**
*   **Status**: "Program Ready"
*   **Program Name**: e.g., "Upper/Lower Split"
*   **Next Workout**: e.g., "Next: Day 1 - Upper Body · 5 exercises"

## 4. Notes
*   **Design Philosophy**: Prominent but friendly reminder. Uses the "success" green color palette to encourage action.
*   **Developer Notes**:
    *   **Display Logic**: Show only if `status == DRAFT` and no active workout.
    *   **Persistence**: Persist across app restarts.
    *   **Dismissal**: Automatically hides when program starts or is replaced.
