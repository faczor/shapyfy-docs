## 2. Human-Readable Summary
**User Behavior**
This is the "manual mode" for users who chose to train on their own. They arrive here to pick specific exercises for their workout. They can search, filter, and select multiple exercises. Once they have at least one exercise, they can start their workout.

**Key Cases**
*   **Selection**: Users tap exercises to add them to their list.
*   **Empty State**: If no exercises are selected, the "Start Workout" button might be disabled or show a prompt.
*   **Starting**: Tapping "Start Workout" takes them to the Active Workout screen with their selected exercises.

**Data Displayed**
*   **Exercise List**: Searchable list of all available exercises.
*   **Selection Count**: "X exercises added".
