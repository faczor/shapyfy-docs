# Problem: Progress Blindness

## The Pain Point
**"Am I even getting stronger?"**
You go to the gym. You sweat. You leave.
But are you actually better than last month? Or are you just spinning your wheels?
Without clear feedback, motivation dies. You feel like you're plateauing, even if you're making small gains. "Progress Blindness" is the #1 killer of gym consistency.

## The Shapyfy Solution
**Instant Visual Feedback ("This Week" Hero Card)**
Shapyfy puts your progress front and center.
- **The Hero Card**: The first thing you see isn't a "Start Workout" button—it's a visualization of your volume this week vs. last week.
- **Micro-Wins**: Even if you only added 1kg or 1 rep, we show you the green "Up" arrow.
- **Gamification**: We give you a weekly volume goal (e.g., 10 tonnes). Filling that bar becomes addictive.

## Social Content Ideas

### Idea 1: The Dopamine Hit (Video)
**Visual**: Close up of the Shapyfy dashboard. The "Volume" bar fills up and turns green.
**Audio**: Satisfying "ding" sound.
**Text**: "Gamify your gains. See your progress instantly."

### Idea 2: The Plateau Breaker (Carousel)
**Slide 1**: "Feels like a plateau." (Sad face)
**Slide 2**: "Actually..." (Shows Shapyfy chart with slow but steady upward trend).
**Slide 3**: "Data doesn't lie. Keep pushing."

### Idea 3: The "Tonnes" Flex
"I lifted 14 tonnes this week. That's 2 elephants. What did you do? Track your total volume with Shapyfy."
