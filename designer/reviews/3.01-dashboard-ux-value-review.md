## 1. Is it Interesting? (Engagement Factor)
**Verdict: YES, High Potential.**

The "Liquid Container" concept is the standout feature here.
*   **Why it works**: Fitness apps are usually dry lists of numbers. A "living" dashboard that fills up as you lift adds a tactile, gamified layer.
*   **The "Alive" Feeling**: The wave animation and bubbles make the app feel active, mirroring the user's physical activity.
*   **Personalization**: The "Adaptive Comparison Messages" (e.g., "You're on fire!" vs "Consistency builds strength") prevent the app from feeling like a robotic spreadsheet. It feels like a coach.

**Observation**: The "Rest Day" mode (changing the whole card aesthetic) is excellent for engagement. It breaks monotony and validates that "Rest is Action".

## 2. Is it Valuable? (Utility Factor)
**Verdict: YES, for Core Users. MAYBE, for Beginners.**

### ✅ High Value Points
1.  **Contextual Plan Hub**: "Why am I here?" is answered immediately. If I have a plan, I see "Day 3: Legs". If not, I see "Start New Workout". It reduces cognitive load.
2.  **Draft Rescue**: The "Resume Draft" banner is a critical fail-safe. Losing workout data is a #1 churn driver in fitness apps. This prevents that.
3.  **Volume Metric (Tonnes)**: For intermediate/advanced lifters (our core demographic), this is a highly satisfying "vanity metric" that correlates with effort.

### ⚠️ Potential Value Gaps
1.  **The "Tonnes" Problem for Beginners**:
    *   *Scenario*: A beginner doing bodyweight squats or light dumbbells might only move 0.5 tonnes week.
    *   *Risk*: The goal of "10 tonnes" might feel impossible or irrelevant.
    *   *FIX*: We might need a "Workout Count" mode for beginners, where the liquid fills based on "3/3 Workouts" instead of volume.
2.  **Long-Term Context**:
    *   The dashboard shows "This Week" vs "Last Week".
    *   *Gap*: It misses the "All Time" progress. Users love streaks.
    *   *Recommendation*: Add a small "Streak" flame icon or counter in the header or next to the profile to hint at long-term consistency.

## 3. The "End User" Verdict

**Does it WOW?**
*   **Visuals**: Yes. The liquid animation + clean cards > Standard list views.
*   **Feel**: The "Rest Day" acknowledgement is a nice empathetic touch.

**Does it WORK?**
*   **Clarity**: The "Start" button at the bottom is unmissable.
*   **Information**: It answers "What did I do?" (Volume) and "What do I do next?" (Plan).

**Critical Recommendation**:
Consider the **Beginner Experience**. If `User.Level == Beginner`, consider defaulting the Hero Card to "Workouts Completed" instead of "Volume". Volume is an abstract concept; showing up is the concrete win for beginners.
