## 1. The Roast (Critique)

### 🚨 Critical Fixes (The Enforcer)
*   **Color Chaos**: You are using generic Material Design colors instead of our **Shapyfy Brand Palette** (`shared/branding.md`).
    *   ❌ `#4CAF50` (Generic Green) → Use **`#2D7A5F` (Functional Primary)** or **`#A8E6CF` (Brand Mint)**.
    *   ❌ `#FF9800` (Generic Orange) → Use **`#FFB86C` (Warning/Amber)**.
    *   ❌ `#F44336` (Generic Red) → Use **`#FF6B6B` (Error Accent)**.
    *   ❌ `#000000` (Pure Black) → Use **`#1A1A1A` (Text Primary)**. Never use pure black.
    *   ❌ `#FF5555` / `#FF8888` (Random Corals) → Use **`#FF9999` (Coral Core)** or **`#FFB3BA` (Coral Light)**.
*   **Typography Oddity**:
    *   ❌ `15sp` is not a standard step. It sits awkwardly between 14sp and 16sp.
    *   **Fix**: Bump to **16sp** for readability or stick to **14sp** for density. Don't invent sizes.

### ⚡ The Vibe Check (The Spark)
*   **Liquid Animation**: 🌊 **LOVE IT.** The bubbles and wave effects are exactly the kind of "alive" UI we want.
*   **Empty State Gradient**: The radial pulse is a great idea, but the colors need to be on-brand (see above).
*   **Comparison Messages**: The "You're on fire!" copy + icons are fantastic. This adds personality.

## 2. The Boost (Creative Suggestions)

*   **Make the "Gold" Special**: You introduced `#FFB800` (Gold) for exceeding goals.
    *   *Critique*: It feels a bit disconnected from the Mint/Coral brand.
    *   *Idea*: What if the "Over Goal" state uses a **Shimmering Gradient** of `Brand Mint` + `Coral Core`? It would look like "Shapyfy Energy" overflowing.
    *   *Alternative*: If you keep Gold, make sure it harmonizes. Maybe add a `Coral` confetti burst?
*   **Interactive Liquid**:
    *   *Idea*: When the user taps the liquid container, can it "splash" or ripple slightly? A simple haptic feedback + wave amplitude jump would make it feel tactile.

## 3. The Verdict

**⚠️ Major Concerns (Should Fix)**
Please align all hex codes with `shared/branding.md` and standardize `15sp` font sizes.

**✅ Strengths**
The "Liquid Container" concept is a winner. It makes data fun.

**Action Items**:
1.  Replace all generic hex codes with Branding tokens.
2.  Change `15sp` to `14sp` or `16sp`.
3.  (Optional) Consider the "Shimmering Mint+Coral" gradient for the "Over Goal" state.
